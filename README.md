# responsive-page project guideline

## Description

Simple page sketch for responsive practices purposses, in this work i use breakpoints for the first time.


## How to Run
1. Go to the folder and make sure you have gulp client install with `gulp -v` or `gulp --version`, if not `run npm install gulp-cli -g`, if gulp is already installed go to the next step.
2. Go to `src/` then install gulp with `npm install gulp`.
3. Finally run the project with `gulp`.

## Project Workflow

All the development files are located in `src/` folder, please do not modify  any *css* from the root folders, it will be overwritten.

> When committing, a wild pre-commit will spawn and will check all your *sass* code quality, so you may need to install *stylelint* client `npm install stylelint`, *gulp-stylelint* client `npm install gulp-stylelint` and *gulp-sass-lint* client `npm install gulp-sass-lint`.
