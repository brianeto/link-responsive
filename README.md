## Description

Simple page sketch for responsive practices purposses, in this work i use breakpoints for the first time.


## How to Run

Go to `src/` then run `gulp`.

All the development files are located in `src/` folder, please do not modify  any *css* from the root folders, it will be overwritten.

> When committing, a wild pre-commit will spawn and will check all your *sass* code quality, so you may need to install *stylelint* client `npm install stylelint`, *gulp-stylelint* client `npm install gulp-stylelint` and *gulp-sass-lint* client `npm install gulp-sass-lint`.
